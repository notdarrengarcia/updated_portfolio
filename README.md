## Updated Portfolio

I have re-coded and spent far more time creating my new portfolio. I have all deployed and usable links for my website. 

I have also put desacriptions on who I am and what I do. 


## LINKED-IN

I added my linkedIn profile by a hyperlink button on the left side of the webpage under the nav. You will also see my Instagram, and Twitter as well.

## ADDED TO MY PORTFOLIO

I added projects to my portfolio that pertain to this class, but since I haven't done a whole lot I just added the best in my opinion. I also added other work I've done such as films and gave links to watch them.
